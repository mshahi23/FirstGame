# Mircrogame Project: Manan's Hot Garbage.

by Manan

## What is Manan's Hot Garbage?
The game is a first person shooter. The player wins when the targets scattered across the level have been shot within a minutes. If the player fails to do so within a minutes they lose. Some of the targets might be hard to find and require minor amounts of platforming.

## Features

The game has a **main menu** which is a unique feature that was not present in rollball. It provides the player the option to start the game (Play), check how the game is played (How To Play) and quit the game (Quit). The player can **move** around using the WASD keys, jump using the spacebar and shoot with the left mouse button. The **in-game UI** has a crosshair and information about the time remaining to beat the game, the number of targets remaining and the players accuracy. The **timer** in the in-game UI is also a unique feature that was not present in rollball. It is important as the game is timed, and when the player wins it shows how fast they beat the game. It encoruages the player to play again for a faster completion time. The game has seperate **backgound music** for the main menu and the game scene. **SFX** for jumping, shooting and hitting the target is present. **Textures** and **prefabs** are present with the help of free asset packs in the Unity Asset store. The game has a **winner screen** and a **game over screen**.
